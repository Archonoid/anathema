		I - About Anathema
===------------------------------------------------------------------------------===

Anathema is an exhaustive suite for all aspects of Exalted series management, 
featuring character and campaign management, media library, script notes and more.

Enjoy.

===------------------------------------------------------------------------------===
		III - Download & Installation
===------------------------------------------------------------------------------===

Anathema is available free at http://sourceforge.net/projects/anathema

Though the .zip-download covers all, we recommend using the OS-specific downloads, if available.

Guides covering installation and general use are available from the project page.

===------------------------------------------------------------------------------===
		III - Launching
===------------------------------------------------------------------------------===

Run the program by typing "java -jar anathema.jar".
Windows users will want to use the executable provided, same goes for Linux and the 
shell script. Automatic desktop integration on Mac OS X is handled by the .dmg download.

Linux users should make sure that either r/w-rights are granted on the Anathema directory or
that a proper directory is specified at startup, using the '-Drepository' parameter, e.g.
  java -Drepository="C:\AnathemaRepository" -jar anathema.jar
to store files in the folder AnathemaRepository on drive C.
The shell script takes care of this.

Anathema needs at least Java Runtime Environment 6.0 to run.
To determine your version please type "java -version". 
You can always get the most up to date version at "http//java.sun.com".

===------------------------------------------------------------------------------===
		VI - Bugs
===------------------------------------------------------------------------------===

Despite our efforts to the contrary, it's most probable that Anathema isn't entirely 
free of bugs. If you should encounter any problems, please report it via the Sourceforge 
project page, using the "Bugs" tracker. 
Thanks for helping us improve!

		IX - Thanks
===------------------------------------------------------------------------------===

Special Thanks to vestrial, for staying with me on this project despite her urges to the contrary.
A huge "Thank you" to Mr. Ricardo Rodriguez who has translated the program to spanish.
Same to Martin, for the cool new artwork.


Philip "The_Burrito" Markus provided much of the Necromancy spell and Lunar Charm data.
Patches did the same for the Dragon Kings.
Thanks to Weltenreiter and Bluerps who long ago helped organizing the data.
To uteck, for efforts in making the user's guide.

Ricardo also deserves to be mentioned for finding innummerable errors & typos within
both code and database. As I said before: You rock!
Thanks to everyone pointing out bugs, be they large or small over the
past two years. 

At http://hd42.de you can visit Mr. Daniel Hohenberger, who first wrote software to 
generate charm tree images. Thank you, you saved us lots of work and inspired us to 
create the fully automated system.

If you are interested in the original version of our character sheets, please
visit voidstate at http://www.voidstate.com. Praises to him, too.
