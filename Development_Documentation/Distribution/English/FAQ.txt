Q: I'm trying to run Anathema on a Mac, but it won't work.
A: Java 6 is not yet available for Mac OS X computers.
	You can use Anathema 1.0 on Java 5. Here's how:
	(Thanks to Nadine, Four Willows Weeping and wordman)
   Macs do support Java 5 on Tiger (Mac OS 10.4).  
   However, it's an additional package available at:
   http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/java2se50release1.html   
   To successfully run Anathema, you need to set the default Java version.
   A tool for this is provided by the J2SE 5.0 update at: 
   /Applications/Utilities/Java/J2SE 5.0/
   Afterwards, use download and run the .dmg provided on the website.

Q: I get a popup window "Could not find the main class. Program will exit."
Q: Running Anathema from the console yields "Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: net/sf/anathema/Anathema (Unsupported major.minor version 49.0)"
A: Most probably, you are running an old version of Java which does not support the 
	advanced features introduced in Java 6. Please go to http://java.sun.com and download
	the most recent Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

Q: How do I determine what version of java I am running or even where my java executable is?
A: Please refer to the Anathema Installation Guide available on the project page.
	
Q: Alright, so I need Java 6. How to get it?
A: Just follow these instructions:
	-Go to http://java.sun.com 
	-Click "Java SE" in the "Popular Downloads"-box in the top right corner. 
	-On the next page, there should be an entry "Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 6". Click "Download". 
	-Follow the on-screen instructions to the end. 
	
Q: Are saved characters and the like going to be compatible between versions?
A: Well, yes. At least, that's what we aim for. If some file happens not to be compatible and you
	cannot find any comment on it in the readme, kindly assume that we screwed up somehow and contact 
	us immediately.
	
Q: How do I grant the neccessary permissions for Anathema to run on Linux?
A: (Thanks to Shattercrack)
	Change permissions by entering 
		chmod 755
	and giving your chosen repository directory as a further parameter.
	If you want to use the default-repository, the directory to specify for the chmod-command
	if the main Anathema directory.
	Note that, depending on your system, you need to be logged in as "root" or "super user" to change
	permissions.
	This should be done by typing 
		su
	before creating the directory.
	
Q: Anathema doesn't run properly on my Linux-Box with Compiz-3D-Desktop.
A: (Thanks to pippo_jedi, using bash)
		$export AWT_TOOLKIT=MToolkit
	So now I'm adding
		AWT_TOOLKIT=MToolkit
		export AWT_TOOLKIT
	to my ~/.bash_profile in my home directory.
	Now anathema works fine.
