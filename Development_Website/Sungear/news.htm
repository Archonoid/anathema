<h2>Bring me your bugs</h2>
<p><b>posted by Urs on 02/11/2007</b></p>
<p>Thanks to the kind people at FogCreek Software, Anathema finally has a decent issue tracking system.</br>
From now on, please submit your bugs and feature requests to <a href="http://anathema.fogbugz.com">FogBugz</a>.
I hope you'll find the system as easy to use as I do.</p>
<p>(Note that this ends our lock on feature requests - we probably won't do anything about them just yet, but knowing
about your needs won't do us any harm.)</p>

<p>Sung to the tune of the Beatles, obviously. Third anniversary. New release as well. Includes stuff by third parties. Which might be removed later.
Must find a way to come up with 5 newsposts in advance. Out. Urs.
<p>Lest I forget: Here's your <a href="?page=downloads">download</a>.<p>

<h2>With All Due Haste</h2>

<p>Months later than I wanted it to, the bugfix release is finally out. It took a while for me to get to terms with some things, and another while till the translations came in.
Some among you will note that the spanish translation is <i>still</i> incomplete, and I am sad to tell you that it might stay so for a while, since our translator, Ricardo, was struck by illness. I hope he'll get better soon.<p>
<p>This release marks a deviation from SOP, since major parts were not written by me, not by Sandra, but by third parties, namely Gareth and Onii. Having made good experience with them, we have decided to open up the program and 
now accept contributions from anyone.<br>
Since some more submissions from their side are already waiting in the pipeline, I hope it won't be too long until you see the first new features roll out.</p> 
<p>Feel free to <a href="?page=contact">contact</a> me about the details once your <a href="?page=downloads">download</a> is done.</p>
